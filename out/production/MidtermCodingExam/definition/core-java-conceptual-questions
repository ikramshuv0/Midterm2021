Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to
 perform specific tasks. It is something which a computer language programmers use to develop software programs,
 scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK (Java Development Kit), is an essential part of creating a functional environment for the Java development
process. The Key components of JDK are-
1. JRE: Java Runtime Environment has JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and other Library Files.
2. javac: Itâ€™s a compiler. And, basically it converts src into Java bytecode.
3.javadoc: It is a documentation generator, which produces documentation from src comments, automatically.
4. jar: It is an archiver. Along with related class libraries packages into one JAR file. Also, it manages those files.
5. javap: it is a Class file disassembler

What is IDE?
A. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software or tools include a text editor, a project editor, a tool bar,
 and an output viewer. It can perform a variety of functions. Notable ones include write code, compile code, debug code,
  and monitor resources. Examples of IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. it starts from Source code where all the commands and instructions of the Java Project. At compile time we convert
src to machine code. then the in runtime, which is the final phase of Program Life Cycle, machine executes that machine
code.

what is class?
A. Class is a blueprint. Like we use blueprint first to create a house. Same here with class in JAVA. It is a template
or a block of codes used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.

What is object?
A. Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category. All class objects should have the basic class
properties.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. Public Static Void Main() {} is the starting point; also it is the main method.

Why main is static?
A. Without main method a compiler cannot execute the program. So, it needs to be shown and that is why we type static.
 Otherwise, an error will be shown as- NoSuchMethodError.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.The Object class, which is stored in the java.lang package.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. These are both Environment Variables but Path is used by operating system to find the executables and Classpath is
used by Java Compiler to find that path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. An Abstract class can implement the functionalities but Interface cannot do that. Interfaces can only define those
functionalities.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, we can not. Because Interface and Abstract classes are not completed one. objects can be created in a complete
Class only.

what is Access Specifier?
A. It decides that class is private or public, or default or protected.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming or OOP has some features, like-
1. Abstraction: Just like before reading the whole book if we read its abstraction we can summarize the book. Same here
to avoid the repetition of same work multiple times,  simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent more
complex underlying code and data.
2. Encapsulation: It keeps the fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods.
3. Polymorphism: Overloading and Overriding.
4. Inheritance: It is used for new classes to inherit some of the attributions from another existing class.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. In Java, under a project we have src and under src we will have packages. And under packages we have class, subclass,
 intefaces etc.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact
 with external software components, operating systems, or microservices. So, an API delivers a user response to a system
  and sends the system's response back to a user.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. We can inherit from one class to another and inherit that one to another.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. It is known as Compile time Polymorphism. It allows a class to have more than one method having the same name even
their arguments are different.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. if something is interrupting the executions it is called Exceptions. There are 2 ways of handling Exceptions-
1. Throwable class method.
2. Try and catch method.
